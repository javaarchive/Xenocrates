# Xenocrates
Wrapper for typesense for my custom search engine idea. Don't expect a lot for now. 
## What it has
* http api for searching
* interfaces for items that go into indexing
* something so it can tell differences between urls
## WHAT IT DOESN'T
* migrate collections on package update. you have to delete database. If I make a change I'll provide a migration script ig.
